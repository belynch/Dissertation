%%% Copyright (c) 1995 by Dinesh Das.  All rights reserved.
%%% This file is free and can be modified or distributed as long as

%%%
%%% (1) This copyright notice is kept intact on all modified copies.
%%% (2) If you modify this file, you MUST NOT use the original file name.
%%%
%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package
%%% utthesis.sty and LaTeX2e to produce a thesis that meets the requirements
%%% of the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin.
%%%
%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see
%%% the file utthesis.sty for these values).  Thus, theoretically, you
%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).
